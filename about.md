Howdy! I'm an engineer at [NeoSensory](http://www.neosensory.com), a startup working on commercializing a wearable sensory substitution device based on research done at the [Eagleman Lab](http://www.eaglemanlab.net/). Right now I'm based in Houston, Texas. I'm always interested talking about techonology, cool projects you're working on, or anything else!
