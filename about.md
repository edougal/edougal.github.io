Who am I?
----


Howdy! I'm an engineer at [NeoSensory](http://www.neosensory.com), a startup working on commercializing a wearable sensory substitution device based on research done at the [Eagleman Lab](http://www.eaglemanlab.net/). I recently moved to San Francisco. I'm always interested in talking about techonology, cool projects, or anything else!
