Howdy! I'm an engineer at [NeoSensory](www.neosensory.com), a startup working on commercializing a wearable sensory substitution device based on research done at the [Eagleman Lab](http://www.eaglemanlab.net/). Right now I'm based in Houston, Texas. If you're around, I'd love to meet and talk about techonology, cool projects you're working on, or anything else.
